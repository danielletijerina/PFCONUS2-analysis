# How to compile and run fortran 90 scripts  

### Compile:  
This creates an executable called "restart_read":    
`gfortran restart_read.f90 -o restart_read`  

### Run:  
To output to the screen/terminal:
`./restart_read`    

To store output in a file, run this instead:  
`./restart_read > date.out`
