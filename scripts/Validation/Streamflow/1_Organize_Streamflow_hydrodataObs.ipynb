    "# This script is split into two main parts: 1) reading in CONUS2 gridded total (aggregated) daily flow for the full domain and creating a dataframe of CONUS2 flow for cells that have been matched with USGS gages in the `NWM_Gage_Adjustments_final.csv`. 2) matching the gages that both have flow between the PF csv and USGS csv retrieved from hydrodata. \n",
