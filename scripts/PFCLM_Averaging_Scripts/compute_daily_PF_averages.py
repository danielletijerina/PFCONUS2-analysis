### Process and save ParFlow daily averages
###########################################

# This script takes hourly PF outputs as PFB files and computes the daily averages to be saved as PFB files.
# DTT & EL, 10/2022

# Inputs:
# - Directory where PF outputs are and directory where you want to save output
# - Hourly PFB files of PF outputs
# - Water year and day start/end

# Outputs:
# - PFB files for daily average of each variable:  
#     - Overland flow at each grid cell (flow) [m^3/h]   
#     - Soil moisture (SM) [-]  
#     - Water table depth (WTD) [m]   
#     - Surface water storage (SURF_WATstorage) [m^3]
#     - Total Subsurface Storage (SUBstorage) [m^3]  
#       - *** To note, the output of SUBstorage is a 3D array of storage for each subsurface layer, 
#       so the GW storage and SM storage can be computed from those files at a later time. Additionally, in order to 
#       compute the TOTAL subsurface storage, one must sum all layers for these arrays. This is different 
#       from the postprocessing done using the Fortran files, where each of the storage components had to be 
#       computed and saved up front. 
   
    
# Notes (10/21/22):
# - Need to determine when is the daily start and end for US time zone, NLDAS3 forcing is UTC
# - Need to add in monthly and yearly averages - Created new script for this since we are processing one month at a time `Compute_month-year_averages_PFCLM.ipynb`
# - ADD UNITS OF CALCULATIONS!
# - *Need to figure out the GW and SM Storage (which layers, do we even want to separate by layer, do by WTD???)
#   - Idea: Create mask from WTD (above and below)?
#   - Don't need to super worry about this now, since the Total Subsurface Storage is a 3D array with storage in each layer. We can calculate GWstorage and SMstorage later.

### DEFINE WATER YEAR, START DAY, & END DAY ###

day_start = 0 #day_start = 0 is the first day of the water year, Oct 1 (e.g., day_start = 2 starts at hour 49)
day_end = 364 #day_end = 364 is the final day of the water year, Sept 30
print(f'Start Day: {day_start}')

#these 3 entries (year, day start and day end) will eventually be argv to the script so that it can be run from bash script
# water_year = int(sys.argv[1])

### DEFINE PATHS ###

## remove input filenames for TopoSlopes to force the data accessor to read the output slopes
## this fixes a windows issue
run.TopoSlopesX.FileName = None
run.TopoSlopesY.FileName = None
slopex = data.slope_x 
slopey = data.slope_y 

## formatting the mask so that values outside the domain are NA and inside the domain are 1
