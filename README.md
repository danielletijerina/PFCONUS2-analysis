## PF-CONUS2 Analysis Scripts

Danielle Tijerina-Kreuzer  

This repository contains analysis scripts for postprocessing and analysis of the ParFlow-CONUS2 integrated hydrologic model.  
The main useful scripts fall into three categories:  
1. Averaging scripts for hourly PFCLM outputs `/scripts/PFCLM_Averaging_Scripts/`  
2. Comparison of PFCONUS2 simulation outputs to various observations `/scripts/Validation/`  
3. Some quick scripts that complete useful tasks in the modeling process `/scripts/quick_scripts/`  
  
It should be noted that **this repo is a work in progress** and many of the scripts are older or continually being updated with new functionality or better scripting (I'm just a hydrologist, after all).  
Reach out with questions or collaborations!
